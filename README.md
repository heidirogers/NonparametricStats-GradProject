# Nonparametric Statistics - Graduate Project
This project was comepleted for the Stat 547 graduate project in nonparametric statitstics and aims to test whether ankle joint bone orientation differs significantly between humans, baboons, and chimpanzees. Analysis was completed entirely in R programming language. The small data set calls for nonparametrics methods including permutation tests and simulation.
The project was completed in four steps, each building upon each other, and identified by check-in number as noted below.

#### Check-in 1:
Creating a function that identifies the "mean" matrix of an array of matrices, and a funcion that identifies the average misorientation angle among the same array of matrices.

#### Check-in 2
Testing and writing code for bootstrapping and permutation tests to test a hypothesis.

#### Check-in 3
Combines the two functions from check-in 1 with a permutation test to test a hypothesis.

#### Check-in 4 
Uses the structure of check-in 3, adding in various hyperparameters to evaluate and plot the power of the permutation tests.

## Data 
Data for this project consists of a csv file containing joint orientation coordinates of each species.
