# Nonparametric Statistics - Graduate Project
This repository contains csv data files, R code files, R markdown files, and pdf files of final outputs relating to the graduate project for Stat 547 (nonparametric statistics) and was completed entirely in R programming language. 
This project aims to test whether ankle joint bone orientation differs significantly between humans, baboons, and chimpanzees.
The small data set calls for nonparametrics methods including permutation tests and simulation.
This project was completed in four steps, each building upon each other, and noted by check-in number.

The final paper pdf contains the final narrative giving background, methods, and a final conclusion along with supporting graphics.

### Check-in 1:
Creating a function that identifies the "mean" matrix of an array of matrices, and a funcion that identifies the average misorientation angle among the same array of matrices.

### Check-in 2
Testing and writing code for bootstrapping and permutation tests to test a hypothesis.

### Check-in 3
Combines the two functions from check-in 1 with a permutation test to test a hypothesis.

### Check-in 4 
Uses the structure of check-in 3 but adds in various hyperparameters to evaluate and plot the power of the permutation tests.

## Usage 
To test this code yourself, download all files in the repository to a common folder. Then in R Studio, open and run R markdown files.
